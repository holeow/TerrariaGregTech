Logistics update! Meet barebones AE2 port for proper gregtech automation. Barebones means you can't use it as a storage solution by itself, Magic Storage heart, crates, super tanks can be connected with storage bus to use them in ME network. Let me know if there are other mods that you think should be supported by storage buses.

Its very minimalistic (no channels, no energy consumption, no drives, no spatial, no quantum, no p2p). Nothing else expect maybe wireless terminals and level emitters isn't planned to be ported. Perchance, when we get to proper endgame playtesting we will encounter some logistical issues that will force us to port more of AE2 but for now it seems okay. But keep in mind that current AE features are already extremely powerful and may break the game balance completely (which they in fact do to 99% of existing Minecraft modpacks) so this is most likely some eternal problem that is yet to be solved by humankind
